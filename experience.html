Industrial Training is a training conducted at all levels of higher education at the Institute of 
Higher Education (HEIs). This Industrial Training Program (LI) is in place to further empower HEIs
to prepare them for the future. In fact, this industry training also gives students the opportunity to experience the real world of work.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font style="arial" size="4">
This training trains students in the skills they need when working. This is because LI provides students with exposure and experience (in terms of effective 
communication, teamwork, work policies, regulations and professional perspectives and ethics). In addition, this exercise enhances the spirit of productivity among students and further 
enhances their confidence. This is important because without confidence, it can be difficult to adjust to the world of work.</font></p>

The Al-Bukhari Library, UiTM Jengka branch of Pahang gave me the opportunity to practicethis industry in their library. Given this opportunity, I can apply 
the theoretical knowledge learned at the HEIs to the best of my ability. With this, I also gained experience in the world of work related tomy field of study and furthered my knowledge.</font></p>
